# Installation

To use Pizza Juice in your project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
yarn add @blockadegames/pizza-juice
```

After installing, you need to set up the Provider at the root of your application. This can be either in your `index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or `App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// 1. import `Provider` component
import { PizzaJuiceProvider } from '@blockadegames/pizza-juice';

const App = () => {
  // 2. Wrap `Provider` at the root of your app
  return (
    <PizzaJuiceProvider>
      <TheRestOfYourApplication />
    </PizzaJuiceProvider>
  );
};
```

Already includes CSS reset, global styles, and a theme.
